```
npm install && npm install -D ~/Downloads/js-playwright-sdk-2.14.0.tgz

```


## Run Tests
`npm run test`

`repeat 5 { npx playwright test --headed ./tests/path/to/some.spec.js }` in case you need to run repeated tests. Requires zsh shell.

`npm run test --ui` will launch the Interactive UI mode by appending the --ui flag.

This script will launch the exec command for the `tests/evinced` directory.
